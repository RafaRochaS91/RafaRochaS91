### Hi there 👋

My name is Rafael Rocha, a Portuguese Software Engineer and Tech Enthusiast living in the north of Germany in a quiet little town.

Always open to lend an helping hand 😎

- **Humanitarian Tech Focus**: My focus is on creating technology that prioritizes clarity, safety, and human dignity over profit or manipulation.

- **Tech Stack**: I mostly focus on web development, I'm mostly using JS/TS with different runtimes and the web platform.

- **Future-Oriented Vision**: Engineer and builder working on empowering both my peers and my consumers. I believe intelligence without integrity is incomplete — and I aim to help create systems that empower, clarify, and protect people.

I want to create a better tomorrow by using my skills for the greater good of society.

Hit me up if there's any projects with this in mind that I can be of assistance!
