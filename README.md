### Hi there 👋

My name is Rafael Rocha, a Portuguese Software Engineer and Tech Enthusiast living in the north of Germany in a quiet little town.

Always open to lend an helping hand 😎

- **Humanitarian Tech Focus**: I’m a software engineer passionate about building open-source and ethical AI systems. My focus is on creating technology that prioritizes clarity, safety, and human dignity over profit or manipulation.  

- **Open Source + Community Focus**: I use my skills in Node.js, React, and Go to strengthen open-source projects that resist misinformation and foster digital sovereignty. My mission is to align technology with values of transparency and care for humanity.  

- **Future-Oriented Vision**: Engineer and builder working on humane AI and decentralized technologies. I believe intelligence without integrity is incomplete — and I aim to help create systems that empower, clarify, and protect people.

I want to create a better tomorrow by using my skills for the greater good of society.
